    <p>In midnight dreary, as I sat alone,
    <p> My thoughts a fading light, my heart a stone.</p>
    <p>From shadows deep, a raven then appeared,</p>
    <p>With eyes like coal, and feathers jagged and weird.</p>
    <br>
    <p>"Nevermore," it seemed to whisper low,</p>
    <p>A haunting word, a specter's grim show.</p>
    <p>And there it perched, upon my chamber door,</p>
    <p>A dark and eerie bird, that filled me with dread core.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With each cawing call, my soul grew weak,<p>
    <p>A prisoner's fate, which I could but speak.</p>
    <p>And so I sat, with darkness cloying me,</p>
    <p>My heart olden, and my spirit finally free.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And as I watched, this raven black and cold,</p>
    <p>I knew my fate, forever to unfold.</p>
    <p>For in its beady gaze, I saw the mark of death,</p>
    <p>A final breath, that would end my fragile breath.</p>
    <br>
    <p> I waited there, with this eerie bird of Poe,</p>
    <p>My heart aching, my soul a'quiver and slow.</p>
    <p>And in the end, I gave it all away,</p>
    <p></p>My life, my love, in one final spray.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thus ends my tale, a poem of Poe's design,</p>
    <p>Of ravens, death, and sorrow's endless line.</p>
    <p>A haunting work, that echoes through the years,</p>
    <p>A legacy that still echoes loud, and near.</p>
